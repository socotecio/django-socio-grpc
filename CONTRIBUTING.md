# Contributing to Django Socio GRPC (DSG)

Thank you for considering contributing to Django Socio GRPC (DSG)! We welcome contributions from anyone, whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with open source.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to DSG, from writing documentation and submitting bug reports to adding new features and fixing bugs. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Submit bugs and feature requests**: If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/socotecio/django-socio-grpc/pulls).

- **Write documentation**: We could always use more documentation, whether it's fixing a typo or adding a new section to the documentation. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the [existing documentation](https://socio-django-grpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and see if there's anything you can improve.

- **Submit pull requests**: If you're comfortable with the codebase, you can submit a pull request with bug fixes or new features. Please make sure to follow the [coding conventions](#coding-conventions), use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting, and run [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks before submitting your changes.

## Coding Conventions

We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code, but we also use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting. Please make sure to follow these conventions when submitting code, and run `black` on your code before submitting your changes.

We also require the use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure that your code meets our standards. Please run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks before submitting your changes.
