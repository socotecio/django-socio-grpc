- **Submit bugs and feature requests**: If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/socotecio/django-socio-grpc/pulls).

- **Write documentation**: We could always use more documentation, whether it's fixing a typo or adding a new section to the documentation. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the [existing documentation](https://socio-django-grpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and see if there's anything you can improve.

- **Submit pull requests**: If you're comfortable with the codebase, you can submit a pull request with bug fixes or new features.
